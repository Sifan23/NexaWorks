NexaWorks: A Modern Office Intranet

Welcome to NexaWorks, a sleek and user-friendly office intranet we built to make work life easier and more connected! Whether you‚Äôre in the office or working remotely, NexaWorks is your hub for team updates, task management, and company resources. We created this for the Frontend Challenge: Office Edition by Axero using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN/UI, TypeScript, and Lucide React for icons. It‚Äôs clean, responsive, and packed with features to keep employees in the loop.
Features
Here‚Äôs what makes NexaWorks awesome:

Light/Dark Mode Toggle: Switch themes via the navbar for a comfy viewing experience.
Team Spotlight: Meet the team with photos, bios, and roles in a responsive grid (grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4) with badges (bg-orange-100/50 text-orange-500 or bg-blue-100/50 text-blue-600).
Event Calendar: Check out upcoming events like workshops, styled with clean cards.
Resource Center: Quick links to company docs and tools.
Announcements: A bar to share big news with everyone.
To-Do List: Track tasks with a calendar picker and checkboxes that turn blue-600 when checked‚Äîsuper satisfying!
Popular Content: See what learning resources employees are loving.
Sidebar Navigation: A collapsible sidebar that highlights the active page (e.g., Home with bg-blue-500 text-white) and shows an avatar badge with ‚Äú5‚Äù for unread inbox messages.
Responsive Design: Looks great on phones, tablets, and desktops with a grid that adapts smoothly.
Profile Options: A dropdown menu for account settings and sign-out.

We used a blue and orange color scheme (text-blue-600/80 for buttons, bg-blue-600 for checkboxes, bg-orange-100/50 text-orange-500 for badges) to keep it vibrant and cohesive.
